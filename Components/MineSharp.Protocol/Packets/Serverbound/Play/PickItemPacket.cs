///     Used to swap out an empty space on the hotbar with the item in the given inventory slot.
///     The Notchian client uses this for pick block functionality (middle click) to retrieve items from the inventory.
///     
///     The server first searches the player's hotbar for an empty slot, starting from the current slot and looping around to the slot before it.
///     If there are no empty slots, it starts a second search from the current slot and finds the first slot that does not contain an enchanted item.
///     If there still are no slots that meet that criteria, then the server uses the currently selected slot.
///     
///     After finding the appropriate slot, the server swaps the items and sends 3 packets:
///     
///         Set Container Slot with window ID set to -2, updating the chosen hotbar slot.
///         Set Container Slot with window ID set to -2, updating the slot where the picked item used to be.
///         Set Held Item, switching to the newly chosen slot.
