# MineSharp.Physics

MineSharp.Physics contains the math and logic to simulate entity movements.
Currently only gravity and forward, backward, right, left movement is supported.

A lot of code is from [Alex](https://github.com/ConcreteMC/Alex/) (a minecraft client written in C#)

It's still missing support for:
 - Jumping
 - Swimming
 - Flying
 - Vehicles
 - (maybe Elytra)
